            <span class="wk1_question">What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</span>
            <br />
            <span class="answer">Answer:</span>
            <br />
            <span class="wk1_answer">Accelerometer, camera, compass, contacts, local storage.  There is a pretty nice size list of functions.</span>
        </p>

        <p class="wk1">
            <span class="wk1_question">For your CRUD app revision and/or Demo App components, which of these do you think you will implement?</span>
            <br />
            <span class="answer">Answer:</span>
            <br />
            <span class="wk1_answer">For me I’d like to experiment with the camera, and the compass.  If I can wrap my head around local storage functionality, that would be huge.</span>
            <br />
        </p>

        <p class="wk1">
            <span class="wk1_question">Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</span>
            <br />
            <span class="answer">Answer:</span>
            <br />
            <span class="wk1_answer">I learned to get started right away so if I run into complications I can hopefully get things ironed out before it’s too late.  It seems there’s not enough time in the day.  So I find that I get more done in the night time when everything is quiet and I can concentrate and read.  I prefer to code in BBedit for a layout plan. And, sometimes if it is a large project I'll map it out first.  I learned from past experiences it's good to start the flow of things out on paper first.  I lay out my file set up first.  I want the links to work first.  Then I move on.  One operation at a time that is a skill I'm working on.</span>
        </p>

        <p class="wk1">
            <span class="wk1_question">Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.<br />
            <span class="answer">Answer:</span>
            <br />
            <span class="wk1_answer">My goal this month is to revise my ASD app.  It does not connect to local storage.  I also would like to start working on app that I would like to send to the market place.  Right now I’m happy tp have enough projects to establish a working portfolio.  That’s my short and long range goals.</span>
        </p>

        <p class="wk1">
            <span class="wk1_question">If not covered above, please also describe any functionality intentions you may have for both the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.<br />
            <span class="answer">Answer:</span>
            <br />
            <span class="wk1_answer">To be honest all of the functions are interesting.  But I only have so much time to learn.  The two functions that sit at the top of my list are the camera, and the compass.  Ill feel successful if I can get those two functions to work with some form of local storage.</span>
